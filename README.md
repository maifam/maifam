 My name is Mai, I am a software engineer with six (6) years of experience in addictions rehab and mental health. I'm a person who strives to understand and help people. I am eager to connect my interpersonal skills along with my technical problem solving skills. 

Growing up during the birth of Facebook and Myspace, I fell in love with coding and have always been curious with the development of web applications. During the pandemic, I utilized my time delving deeper into coding. I commited to Flatiron School after teaching myself for two months. 

The immersive rigorous program taught me not only Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React, Redux, CSS, HTML, PostgreSQL and SQL, but it taught me time-management and patience. In March 2021, I completed Flatiron School's Software Engineer program. 

When I am not coding and learning about new technologies, I love to spend time outdoors hiking 🏔, traveling 🌍 and eating 🍽! 

I would love to connect and collaborate on future projects! 😀
